# Test: Design a Credit Card Transaction Processing System

As a Senior Principal Architect candidate, you are tasked with creating a high-level design for a credit card transaction processing system. 
This system should be able to process credit card transactions securely, efficiently, and reliably. 

The design should include key subsystems and interactions involved in the transaction flow.

## Subsystems to consider:

- Point of Sale (POS) Terminal
- Merchant Server
- Payment Gateway
- Card Issuer Server
- Card Network (e.g., Visa, Mastercard)
- Fraud Detection System
- Database System for transaction and user information storage


## Tasks

1. Provide a high-level overview of the credit card transaction processing system, describing the main purpose of each subsystem.
2. Draw a sequence diagram to illustrate the interactions between subsystems for the following use cases:
- Purchase Transaction
- Authorization
    
3. Briefly discuss the strategies for handling high loads and ensuring scalability of the system.

## Evaluation Criteria:

The candidate will be assessed based on the following aspects:

- Understanding of the transaction processing flow and subsystems involved
- Clarity and accuracy of the sequence diagrams
- Scalability and performance considerations
- Communication and presentation of the design solution
